**1. A college is building a new dormitory on its campus. Workers are digging in the ground to install a new water pipe for the dormitory. A worker accidentally damages a fiber optic cable that connects two of the existing dormitories to the campus data center. Although the cable has been cut, students in the dormitories only experience a very short interruption of network services. What characteristic of the network is shown here?**

- fault tolerance
- integrity
- quality of service (QoS)
- scalability
- security

**Explanation:** Fault tolerance is the characteristic of a network which allows it to quickly respond to failures of network devices, media, or services. Quality of service refers to the measures taken to ensure that network traffic requiring higher throughput receives the required network resources. Scalability refers to the ability of the network to grow to accommodate new requirements. Security refers to protecting networks and data from theft, alteration, or destruction. Integrity refers to the completeness of something and is generally not used as a characteristic of networks in the same way as the other terms.

**2. Which feature relies on prioritization of network traffic and is used to ensure successful delivery of real-time services?**

- security
- redundancy
- quality of service
- reliability

**Explanation:** Quality of Service (QoS) is implemented in networks to prioritize traffic. Traffic for real-time services such as voice and video requires a higher priority than data traffic to ensure reliable delivery of voice and video content to users.

**3. A networking technician is working on the wireless network at a medical clinic. The technician accidentally sets up the wireless network so that patients can see the medical records data of other patients. Which of the four network characteristics has been violated in this situation?**

- fault tolerance
- security
- scalability
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- reliability

**Explanation:** Network security includes protecting the confidentiality of data that is on the network. In this case, because confidential data has been made available to unauthorized users, the security characteristic of the network has failed.

**4. Which term describes the state of a network when the demand on the network resources exceeds the available capacity?**

- convergence
- synchronization
- congestion
- optimization

**Explanation:** When the demand on the network resources exceeds the available capacity, the network becomes congested. A converged network is designed to deliver multiple communication types, such as data, video and voice services, using the same network infrastructure.

**6. What type of address is physically assigned to the NIC of a workstation?**

- MAC address
- host address
- IP address
- network address

**Explanation:** A MAC address is physically assigned to the host NIC and is known as the physical address. The physical address remains the same regardless of where the host is placed on the network. The IP address is known as a logical address because it is assigned logically based on where the host is located. IP addresses contain two parts, network address and host address.

**7. An administrator is adding voice and video service capabilities to an existing network. What design requirement is being satisfied by this situation?**

- availability
- security
- manageability
- scalability

**Explanation:** Scalability refers to the ability of a network to expand to support new users, services, and applications. In this example, scalability allows the administrator to expand the ability of the network to support voice and video.
